## project description
Implementation of a mobile event platform that digitizes private events and events initiated by organizations (e.g. student councils). The app should contain all natural event features such as a map on which events are displayed or the search for specific events. In addition, features should be implemented that will enable all invited/joined persons to participate in the design of the events or can be better managed and updated by the organizer.
